            This exercise uses an API, please review the documentation <a href="api-docs.html" target="_blank">here</a>. The base URL for the API is the URL for this page (ie. if the URL for this page is <code>https://ellevest-take-home.glitch.me</code> the Transfers API endpoint would be <code>https://ellevest-take-home.glitch.me/transfers</code>).

            Thank you for your interest in Ellevest! For this exercise, you'll be working to build part of a "Venmo-like" system of payments between users. In Part I you'll build the data for a "social" payments feed. In Part II, you'll implement a method for sending a new payment through the API. The API referenced above provides endpoints for Transactions, Accounts, Users, and Likes and includes all the information you'll need to successfully complete this exercise. While not truely "live" this API supports GET, POST, and PUT operations for all resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may use the language of your choice for this exercise and your implementation should be runnable. The exercise should take you no more than two hours to complete. When you're done, please email <a href="mailto:people@ellevest.com">people@ellevest.com</a> with your attached solution.

          <h2>Part I</h2>
          <p>
            Using the API, implement a method to build the data for a "social" transactions feed, combining information from whichever API resources are necessary. Transactions with a "failed" status should be excluded from the feed. Your method should return an Array of Objects (Hashes, Dictionaries, etc.) with the following information:

        <div class="row">
          <h2>Part II</h2>
          <p>
            Using the API, implement a method to create a new Transfer between two users. Before creating the Transfer, your method should confirm that the funds are available in the origin Account. This method should return the new Transfer Object.
